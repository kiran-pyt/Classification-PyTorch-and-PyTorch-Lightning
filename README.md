**Classification-PyTorch-and-PyTorch-Lightning**
The creation and application of a "squeezing and expanding" categorization network is the primary objective of this investigation. Pytorch and Pytorch-lighiting were both utilised in the construction of the same network so that a comparison could be made between the two.The following network was evaluated utilising the smallest dataset.
