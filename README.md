**Classification-PyTorch-and-PyTorch-Lightning**

The main goal of this study is to develop and use a "squeezing and expanding" network for classfication. Pytorch and Pytorch-lighiting were both utilised in the construction of the same network so that a comparison could be made between the two.The following network was evaluated utilising the minst digit dataset.
